# Using-Python-and-Jupyter-Notebooks-on-TSCC

* **Date:**  Thursday, September 2, 2021
* **Time:** 1:00 PM - 4:00 PM PDT

This event will be held remotely.

The Triton Shared Computing Cluster (TSCC) is UC San Diegoâ€™s primary research HPC system. It is foremost a "condo cluster" (researcher-purchased computing hardware) that provides access, colocation, and management of a significant shared computing resource, as well as providing a "hotel" service for those with temporary or bursty HPC needs. Like many research scientists, the TSCC community has been increasing its usage of interactive services such as Jupyter Notebooks.

This workshop will focus on providing guidelines for setting up customized Python environments, how to install and manage packages using Miniconda/pip, and how to run secure Jupyter notebooks on TSCC.
